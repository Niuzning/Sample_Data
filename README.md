# Sample_Data
We're sharing sample data for ten scenarios in our paper, including PV energy output, household load, charging demand, and parking times of 50 EVs.

"PV energy output" represents the PV output power profile in 15-minute intervals throughout the day, measured in /kW.
"household base load" represents the household power profile in 15-minute intervals throughout the day, measured in /kW.
"Charging demand" represents the energy required by EVs, measured in /kWh
"Parking time" represents the moments when EVs are parked, with 15-minute intervals.
